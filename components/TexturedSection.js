        Textured art is a form of visual expression that goes beyond the surface—literally. It involves building layers,
        depth, and tactile elements into the artwork, creating a rich, three-dimensional experience. Each piece invites
        not just visual engagement but a sensory connection, where texture becomes as important as color or composition.
        Through the use of mixed media, sculptural techniques, and expressive brushwork, textured art adds emotion,
        movement, and energy to a canvas. For me, it’s a way to bring ideas to life in a more immersive and powerful way,
        allowing viewers to feel the story as much as they see it.
