    <p className={styles.description}>
    I am a Sri Lankan artist, gradually carving my space in the creative industry
    through passion, persistence, and a deep love for visual storytelling.
    From a young age, art has been my safe spaceâ€”what began as playful sketches quickly
    became a lifelong companion. Without formal training, I developed my skills through years
    of practice, observation, and exploration, allowing my creativity to grow naturally.
    As I experimented with different forms, I discovered the quiet magic that exists between
    emotion and creation, leading me to the surreal, symbolic style I embrace today.
    Inspired by nature, spirit, and the human experience, my work is deeply personal
    yet open for interpretation, inviting others to find connection, emotion, and imagination within each piece.
